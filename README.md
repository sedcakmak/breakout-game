Breakout game on HTML5 canvas

With this project, I focused on learning the canvas with the guidance of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

I implemented extra features such as increasing the speed of the ball and randomizing its color & angle. Also I made adjustments with the paddle and corrected several minor issues.
